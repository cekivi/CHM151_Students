# CHM151_Students

The CHM 151 Python Module consists of 4 components:
  -  An optional Tutorial covering Python basics
  -  Experiment 8: Kinetics of Aquation teaching how to perform linear regressions
  -  Experiment 9: Enzyme Kinetics teaching how to perform multi-variable regressions
  -  Experiment 10: Solar Cells teaching how to perform parabolic regressions

Modules should be completed in the same order as the experiments. 
Simulated data is provided if you want to practice prior to performing the experiment.

At the moment only the tutorial is available. The remining files will be added in early January.
