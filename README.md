# CHM151_Students

The CHM 151 Python Module consists of 4 components:
  -  Lab 0: An optional Tutorial covering Python basics
  -  Experiment 8: Solar Cells teaching how to perform parabolic regressions
  -  Experiment 9: Kinetics of Aquation teaching how to perform linear regressions
  -  Experiment 10: Enzyme Kinetics teaching how to perform multi-variable regressions
  -  Tutorial - with Dye: Finding the molar absorptivity from a simulated data set to help you learn how do regressions on Python

Modules should be completed in the same order as the experiments. 
Simulated data is provided if you want to practice prior to performing the experiment.

At the moment only the tutorial is available. The remining files will be added in early January.
